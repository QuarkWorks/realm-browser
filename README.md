### Description

Android [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-java) Browser

This was a fork of [jonasrottmann/realm-browser](https://github.com/jonasrottmann/realm-browser) which we used in the past to update the Realm version to the then current version (0.91) for use in debug builds for one of our apps. 

jonasrottman has since merged our fork and updated the Realm version periodically. We recommend using his repository in your codebase.
